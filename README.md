Conan support for the tableau extract api.

## Sample Project

Please take a look at the `sample_projects` directory to see how to setup
your project to consume the Tableau Extract API for C++ with
[conan](http://conan.io)

## OSX Caveat

Because of rpath, you must install the .framework files from the `.dmg`
into `/Library/Frameworks`.  You can download the `.dmg` from
the [Tableau Help Files](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/api/sdk/en-us/SDK/tableau_sdk_installing.htm)

## Windows Caveat

I haven't tested the windows side of things yet.
